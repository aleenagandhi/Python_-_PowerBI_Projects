# Python_and_PowerBI_Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing various projects developed using Python and Power BI. This repository includes:

Python Projects: Explore a range of projects that leverage Python for data analysis and machine learning. Projects demonstrate the application of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms including KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Power BI Dashboards: Dive into interactive dashboards created with Power BI. These dashboards visualize data to provide actionable insights and support decision-making processes in different domains.

Feel free to browse through the code, explore the projects, and leverage the examples for your own learning or development purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Let me know if youâ€™d like any adjustments or additional details!
